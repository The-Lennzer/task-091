title: "The Tasks"
---
The foss tasks were like an overall new experience to me as I've literally never done anything like this before. I used to be a regular school-going kid restricted from all sort of stuff like this and the tasks were a good breakout from that.
I started to realise there's more to it than what I thought and all the tasks i did felt like a gateway into a new world. Even though I was not able to complete some tasks or perfect some, it sure helped me learn a lot and also gave me the idea of improvising with what we have. It also trained me to understand things and find information about new stuff quickly and easily. 
Also, most of the tasks were intresting and makes you want to know about them more and more. The tasks were hard but I'd say it's worth it!
